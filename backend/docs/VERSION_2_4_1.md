# WebAgent Backend Version 2.4.1 Update

This document describes the implementation details of version 2.4.1, which focuses on enhancing reliability, security, and observability.

## Integration Testing Improvements

### Previous Issue
In version 2.4.0, integration tests were marking tests as "passed" even when failures occurred during testing mode. This could hide real issues and make tests less reliable.

### Solution
- Redesigned test reporting structure with detailed status codes: passed, failed, skipped
- Added specific error capture with complete traceback information
- Implemented continuing and non-continuing failure modes to allow test suite to proceed when appropriate
- Added test summary with clear metrics on passed, failed, and skipped tests
- Set non-zero exit codes when tests fail to integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Security Enhancements

### Rate Limiting Improvements
- Added Redis support for distributed rate limiting across multiple instances
- Implemented burst limit feature to allow short bursts of higher traffic
- Added Retry-After headers to rate limiting responses
- Enhanced logging for rate limit violations
- Proper configuration injection from settings

### Input Sanitization
- Comprehensive HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Added truncation of extremely long inputs to prevent DoS attacks
- Extended pattern matching for dangerous content:
  - JavaScript protocol handlers
  - Event handler attributes
  - SQL injection patterns
  - Data URIs and other dangerous elements

### JWT Token Handling
- Added specific handling for expired token errors
- Added Not Before (nbf) and Issued At (iat) claims
- Enhanced token validation logging
- Clear error messages for different token validation issues

## Metrics and Monitoring Improvements

### Path Normalization
- Added path normalization to prevent high cardinality in metrics
- Implemented pattern matching for common path elements:
  - UUIDs and numeric IDs
  - Task IDs and other dynamic segments
  - Consistent grouping of similar endpoints

### New Metrics
- Added configuration validation metrics to track configuration issues
- Added API key validation metrics to track authorization issues
- Added memory usage metrics for RSS and VMS memory
- Added error metrics by type and component
- Added more detailed LLM request tracking

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved token counting logic with error handling
- Better error handling in middleware components
- Added detailed error reporting with context information
- Improved timestamp tracking for errors

## Middleware Optimizations

### Ordering and Efficiency
- Corrected middleware ordering for better security and performance:
  1. Metrics middleware first to ensure all requests are tracked
  2. Security headers early in the chain
  3. Size limiting before content processing
  4. CORS at the end of the chain
- Added specific exclusion list for monitoring endpoints to prevent recursion issues
- Enhanced performance for metrics collection with targeted collection

## Configuration Management

- Added tracking for configuration validation events
- Improved error handling in configuration loading
- Added validation metrics for API keys
- Enhanced documentation of configuration options

## Summary

Version 2.4.1 maintains all the production-ready features of 2.4.0 while addressing reliability concerns, enhancing security measures, and improving observability. These changes make the system more robust in production environments and easier to maintain and monitor.

The key theme of this update is enhanced reliability - ensuring that issues are properly detected, reported, and addressed rather than hidden behind overly permissive error handling.
